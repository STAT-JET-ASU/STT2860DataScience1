#### Take the DataCamp assessment [Data Manipulation with R](https://assessment-v2.datacamp.com/exploratory-analysis-r). 

**What score did you achieve on Data Manipulation with R?**

ANSWER: 127

**You performed better than what percent of other people?**

ANSWER: 81%

**What courses did DataCamp recommend for you to improve?**

ANSWER: DataCamp recommended that I complete the course Introduction to Data Analysis with ggplot2 and Intermediate Data Visualization with ggplot2. However, looking at my wrong answers, I can see that some were due to sloppy coding (e.g., a missing parenthesis) rather than not knowing what to do.
