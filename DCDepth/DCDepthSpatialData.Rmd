### **1st Course: [Interactive Maps with leaflet in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/interactive-maps-with-leaflet-in-r)**

#### **Suggested Prerequisite**

Introduction to the Tidyverse

#### **DC Course Description**

Get ready to have some fun with maps! Interactive Maps with leaflet in R will give you the tools to make attractive and interactive web maps using spatial data and the tidyverse. In this course, you will create maps using the IPEDS dataset, which contains data on U.S. colleges and universities. Along the way, you will customize our maps using labels, popups, and custom markers, and add layers to enhance interactivity. Following the course, you will be able to create and customize your own interactive web maps to reveal patterns in your data.

### **2nd Course: [Visualizing Geospatial Data in R](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/visualizing-geospatial-data-in-r)**

#### **Suggested Prerequisite**

Introduction to Data Visualization with ggplot2

#### **DC Course Description**

Where should you buy a house to get the most value for your money? Your first step might be to make a map, but spatial analysis in R can be intimidating because of the complicated objects the data often live in.

This course will introduce you to spatial data by starting with objects you already know about, data frames, before introducing you to the special objects from the sp and raster packages used to represent spatial data for analysis in R. You'll learn to read, explore, and manipulate these objects with the big payoff of being able to use the tmap package to make maps.

By the end of the course you will have made maps of property sales in a small town, populations of the countries of the world, the distribution of people in the North East of the USA, and median income in the neighborhoods of New York City.

### **3rd Course: [Analyzing US Census Data in R](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/analyzing-us-census-data-in-r)**

#### **Suggested Prerequisite**

Introduction to the Tidyverse  
Visualizing Geospatial Data in R

#### **DC Course Description**

Analysts across industries rely on data from the United States Census Bureau in their work. In this course, students will learn how to work with Census tabular and spatial data in the R environment. The course focuses on the tidycensus package for acquiring data from the decennial US Census and American Community survey in a tidyverse-friendly format, and the tigris package for accessing Census geographic data within R. By the end of this course, students will be able to rapidly visualize and explore demographic data from the Census Bureau using ggplot2 and other tidyverse tools, and make maps of Census demographic data with only a few lines of R code.
