## Greetings!

Welcome to the first day of STT 2860 Intro to Data Management and Visualization with Dr. Jill Thomley. To prepare for the start of our exciting journey...

* Log on to [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/)!

* Find and open the link "STT 2860 Spring 2023 Syllabus"

* Find and open the link "Day 01 Introduction Slides"

* Begin to familiarize yourself with the course documents and our AsULearn site. AsULearn is the vital hub of our course for assignments and communication.

We will do some activities to make sure we are set up on course technology and familiar with course structure / expectations.

## Motivating Philosophies

From: [ASA Statement on the Role of Statistics in Data Science](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/)

The foundations of data science include, but are not limited to: database management, statistics/machine learning, distributed and parallel computing. **/multidisciplinary/**

"Framing questions statistically allows us to leverage data resources to extract knowledge and obtain better answers." **/finding answers and solving problems/**

"Statistical methods aim to focus attention on findings that can be reproduced by other researchers..." **/reproducible research/**

"...next generation of statistical professionals needs a broader skill set and must be more able to engage with database and distributed systems experts." **/beyond point-and-click/**


## A New Generation of Coding

“Starting September 1 [2016], JASA ACS will require code and data as a minimum standard for reproducibility of statistical scientific research. New infrastructure is being established to support this initiative … A new editorial role—associate editor for reproducibility (AER)—will be added to ensure we meet a standard of reproducibility.” ([Reproducible Research in JASA](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2016/07/01/jasa-reproducible16/))

ASA also released [Recommendations to Funding Agencies for Supporting Reproducible Research](https://www.amstat.org/ASA/News/ASA-Develops-Reproducible-Research-Recommendations.aspx) in January 2017, suggesting more statistician reviewers to assess quality of plans for data management and research reproducibility.

Potential barrier: researchers may lack programming and “best practices” skillsets. Also, some disciplines or organizations may not recognize computer data and code as research products in and of themselves. 


## Where I Learned to Code

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src = "images/rpivcc.jpg" width=500;></p>

The Chapel was acquired by RPI in 1958 and transformed into the VCC in 1976. President [Low](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/apollo-8-george-low-profile-180970807/) stated it was "the most unique computing center in the world." (There was a definitely a *lot* of invoking of deities, in my experience...)


## Multidisciplinary Data Science!

Where are you in this diagram? Let's explore this for ourselves.

## Sign on to RStudio Server

Use your ASU Username and Password to log in to the [RStudio server](https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/). Let me know if you have any trouble! Also make sure to complete "Confirm ASU RStudio server login" on AsULearn.

<p>[DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) is an "intuitive learning platform" for data science. Learn concepts and R code via short videos and hands-on-the-keyboard exercises, with feedback on each exercise.</p>

<p>Multiple tracks for people with different interests and needs.</p>

<p>[ASA on Data Science](http://magazine.amstat.org/blog/2015/10/01/asa-statement-on-the-role-of-statistics-in-data-science/): “Statistical education and training must continue to evolve…”</p>

<p>We will use DataCamp extensively for learning and practice. It's how I initially learned many of my data science skills. We'll also explore some of the tracks related to Data Science.


## Sign on to DataCamp

* Sign in or create an account on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Use your ASU email address.

* Go into your profile and add your first and last name so it shows up on the class roster.

* Join our DataCamp class. The link for this is on AsULearn.

* Finally, complete "Confirm DataCamp account creation" on AsULearn sometime after class is over.

You will have six months of free access to DataCamp, during which you can access all content --- not just courses I assign.

<p>**Git** : an open-source version control and collaboration system</p>

<p>[GitHub](https://github.com/) : web-based hosting service (hub) for version-controlled projects using Git, with some added features</p>

<p>You will learn more about this resource in upcoming weeks.


## Your Private Forum

Except for extreme emergencies, all written communication must be handled through your **Private Forum** on AsULearn. This will be new for most of you. 

I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them all semester long and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email (which can turn into a black hole).

<p style = "text-align: center;">Let's go to AsULearn and take a look!</p>


## Syllabus and Schedule

Shortly we will switch over to the course syllabus and talk some more about objectives and assessments.

As we review, remember that STT 2860 is a 3 credit hour course. The standard expectation for a college course is that you spend **2 to 3** hours outside of class for every **1** hour spent in class.

<p style="text-align: center;">3 + ((2 to 3) &times; 3) = 9 to 12 hours per week</p>

Weeks where you have a full DataCamp course, that will take up about four hours of time. **In-class time is only 2.5 hours/week.**

Basic mathematics proficiency is the only course prerequisite. You are not expected to have stats or programming experience. If you have one or both, you **might** not require as much time to master course concepts, but do not assume until you try. 


##

Explorations

* engage with digital textbooks and other online materials
* watch assigned videos and participate in other activities 
* come to class, take organized notes, actively participate
* use office hours to get individualized attention/feedback

Assignments

* complete assigned DataCamp modules
* complete assigned homework and projects
* practice new and existing data science and `R` skills
* solidify knowledge and make new connections
* review and understand your misconceptions
* demonstrate content and skill proficiency


## Learning to Code

One of our goals in this class is reproducible research and code; this includes learning to make our code readable to others.

```{r}

```

Coding is often multi-stage: we get something that works first, then we refine it to make it more efficient and readable.
