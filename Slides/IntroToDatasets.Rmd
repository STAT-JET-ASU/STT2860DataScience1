# Dataset Structure

## Essential Vocabulary

* A ***variable*** is some characteristic of interest that can differ between individuals in a population.

* An observational unit (or ***observation***) is a single individual, object, or entity about which collect data, regarding one or more of its characteristics (variables).

* An observation may be called a case, subject, or participant.

* Ideally, each observational unit has a value for each variable.

A ***dataset*** is a collection of data values for the observations and variables in a study (e.g., survey or experiment). A common way to arrange data is to put variables in columns and observations in rows. This is what we call ***tidy*** data. 


## What is "Tidy" Data?

<p>Some of the data we will work with in STT2860 is already in tidy format, though there may be missing data and other issues we have to address before conducting analyses.</p>

<p>Real life data is often quite messy. We will explore a few ways to make datasets more tidy during this course.</p>


## Review: Vectors in `R`

Atomic vectors can contain only one type of data, while ***lists*** can contain more than one type of vector or data. In `R`, a ***data frame*** or ***tibble*** (dataset) is a special type of list.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/VectorHierarchy.png", dpi = 350)
```

<div style = "text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">Hierarchy of vectors in `R` (from [R for Data Science: Vectors](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html))</div>


## Vectors & Datasets

Each variable (column) in a tibble or dataset is a vector. These vectors may be of different types. It is helpful to visualize this when planning how to manipulate data.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/dataframevectors.png", dpi = 140)
```

# Exploring Datasets

## What's in a Dataset?

Before doing any kind of data modeling or inference, you need to examine your dataset and become familiar with its structure and contents---this is ***exploratory data analysis (EDA)***.

John Tukey (1915â€“2000), author of the seminal book *Exploratory Data Analysis* (1977), referred to EDA as numerical, counting, and graphical detective work. He is also credited with introducing the now-familiar terms "bit" and "software" while working with early computers at Bell Labs.

We will use the ***dplyr*** and ***ggplot2*** packages for manipulation and visualization. These tools and more are part of the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).

We will learn how to read a few different types of data files into `R` (e.g., text files, Excel spreadsheets, data stored on the web, `R` formatted data files), as well as how to save data files.


## Datasets in `R`

A data frame or tibble is a two dimensional structure/array in `R`. It is a special case of a list where each component (column) has equal length and can contain a different variable type.

The core installation of `R` (i.e., `{base} R`) includes many built-in datasets. We can get a list using the `data()` function.

Entering `data()` in the Console pane of RStudio will open a new tab/window listing the names of all the built-in datasets. 

We can get a list of the datasets found in other packages using `data(package = "packagename")`. For example, all the data in ggplot2 can be found using `data(package = "ggplot2")`.

Try `data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))` .


## Example Dataset

Consider the `Nightingale` dataset from the HistData package.

We can access the data using `HistData::Nightingale` or load the HistData package using the `library()` function. Let's assign the dataset to an object in our environment.

```{r}
library(HistData)
nightingale <- Nightingale   # all lowercase can be more convenient
```

Examine the dataset in your Environment pane.

* How many variables (columns) are there?
* What is the vector type for each of the variables?
* How many observational units/cases (rows) are there? What does each case represent?


## Environment Pane

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nightingale_environment.PNG", dpi = 90)
```


## Some Functions for Exploring

The environment pane is using functions behind the scenes to display some of the information we can see. We can use these functions directly to explore dataset structure.

`head()` / `tail()` are closely related; so are `str()` / `glimpse()` 

```{r eval = FALSE}
head(nightingale)     # this function is part of base R code
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
tail(nightingale)     # this function is part of base R code
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
str(nightingale)      # this function is part of base R code
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
glimpse(nightingale)  # this function is from package dplyr
```


## Visualize Structure

What information does `str()` give you about the dataset?

```{r}
str(nightingale)     # this function is part of base R code
```


## 

How are the outputs of `str()` and `glimpse()` similar? How are they different? Which does the RStudio Environment pane use?

```{r}
glimpse(nightingale)
```


## Other Useful Functions

A few functions for exploring dataset structure are given below. What information does each give you?

* `attributes()`
* `names()`
* `dim()`
* `nrow()`
* `ncol()`
* `head()`
* `tail()`
* `sum(complete.cases())` # this is two nested functions
* `sum(!complete.cases())` # what does the ! do?


## 

```{r}
attributes(nightingale)
```

```{r}
typeof(nightingale)
```


## Explore some more datasets!

Try exploring some of the datasets in the HistData package, or those you can find in `R` and the tidyverse packages. You will see some of these pop up in DataCamp modules.

Practice to become proficient in loading data and investigating structure so you can start the important work of transforming raw data into useful information and knowledge.

These functions also will be useful when you manipulate data. They can help you can check that you achieve the structure you want/need. For example...

* Did you create a new variable properly? 
* Did you filter out any cases you did not want?
* Did you successfully rearrange or "tidy" the data?


# Build from Scratch

## Using `data.frame()`

We can build a dataset from scratch (i.e., from vectors) using the `data.frame()` function.

Within the `data.frame()` function, we specify *variable name* = *a vector of values for the variable*. All the vectors must be the same length (i.e., same number of cases).


```{r}
dataset1 <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:5,
  gender = c("male", "male", "female", "female", "nonbinary"),
  height = c(71, 73, 64, 64, 66),
  weight = c(175, 225, 130, 125, 165)
)
```

Notice the structure of the code, including the indenting and `()`.

##

```{r}
glimpse(dataset1)
head(dataset1)
```

## Using `tibble()`

A tibble is an "upgraded" dataset structure from the tidyverse. However, it works very similarly to `data.frame()`.

```{r}
dataset2 <- tibble(
  ID = 1:5,
  gender = c("male", "male", "female", "female", "nonbinary"),
  height = c(71, 73, 64, 64, 66),
  weight = c(175, 225, 130, 125, 165)
)
```

One major difference between `data.frame()` and `tibble()` is the way it formats the vectors. The `tibble()` function generally imposes *less* structure. For example, it does not turn character data into a factor vector by default.

How else are the different? Use your exploratory functions!


##

```{r}
glimpse(dataset1)
```

```{r}
glimpse(dataset2)
```


## Example with Missing Data

Remember, `NA` is `R`'s system character for missing data, similar to how `NULL` means no vector.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
dataset3 <- tibble(
  ID = c(1, 2, 4, 5, 7),
  sex = c("male", "male", "female", "nonbinary", NA),
  visits = c(1, 2, 4, 12, 2),
  checkup = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
  follow_up = c(NA, 0, 1, 2, 0),
  illness = c(0, 0, 2, 7, 1 ),
  surgery = c(0, 0, 0, 2, 0),
  ER = c(0, 1, 0, 0, NA),
  Test = NULL
)
```


## 

```{r}
glimpse(dataset3)
```

Use your other exploratory functions. Also, what happened to the `Test` variable?


## Making a List

A data frame or tibble is a special case of an object type called a list. A list is essentially a collection of other objects (e.g., vectors, datasets, formulas, etc.). They are created using `list()`. You can start from scratch or gather existing objects into a list. 

```{r}
list1 <- list(
  a = 2,                # constant/vector of length 1
  b = 1:3,              # integer vector of length 3
  d = c("Fred", "Joe")  # character vector of length 2
)
```

```{r}
list2 <- list(
  dataA = dataset1,   # dataset we made earlier
  dataB = dataset2,   # dataset we made earlier
  dataC = mtcars      # dataset included in R
)
```
