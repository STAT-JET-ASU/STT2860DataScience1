## Before We Begin...

These slides are not meant to be standalone information. You should take notes to flesh out the contents. I recommend that you create an R Markdown document where you can combine information and code from the slides and your own additional notes and explorations to make connections.

# Review: Datasets

## Dataset Structure

* A ***variable*** is some characteristic of interest that can differ between individuals in a population.

* An observational unit (or ***observation***) is a single individual, object, or entity about which collect data, regarding one or more of its characteristics (variables).

* An observation may be called a case, subject, or participant.

* Ideally, each observational unit has a value for each variable.

A ***dataset*** is a collection of data values for the observations and variables in a study (e.g., survey or experiment). A common way to arrange data is to put variables in columns and observations in rows. This is what we call ***tidy*** data.

<p>Many datasets are already in tidy format, though there may be missing data and other issues we have to address before doing data analysis and visualization.</p>

<p>Real life data is usually far messier and can require a great deal of tidying. The dplyr verbs help us to get data into tidy format and to modify it in other ways, such as creating new variables.</p>

## Exploring Structure

A few functions for exploring dataset structure are given below. 

* `glimpse()` # requires tidyverse
* `attributes()`
* `dim()` # dimensions, rows &times; columns
* `names()`
* `nrow()`
* `ncol()`
* `head()`
* `tail()`
* `sum(complete.cases())` # this is two nested functions
* `sum(!complete.cases())` # what does the ! do?

## Example Dataset

* Statistician Francis Galton (1822-1911), a cousin of Charles Darwin, studied the relationship between parents' heights and the heights of their offspring. His pioneering [1886 article](https://galton.org/essays/1880-1889/galton-1886-jaigi-regression-stature.pdf) is the first appearance of regression analysis in print. 

* The `galtonfamiliesall` dataset we will be working with was [partly reconstructed by Dr. James A. Hanley](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/) and his students from [original paper notebooks](http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/epidemiology/hanley/galton/notebook/index.html) containing handwritten data for 205 families that was gathered by Galton. 

* Galton's made comments about how he "transmuted" some of the data for analysis. As with most historical data, gender is a binary variable for both parents and children.

## Read in the Data

You can access the Galton data file from the [description](https://stat-jet-asu.github.io/Datasets/InstructorDescriptions/galtonheightdata.html) page, which also contains more context and variable definitions.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
galtondata <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT-JET-ASU/Datasets/master/Instructor/galtonfamiliesall.csv")
```

```{r}
head(galtondata)
```

Question: Why is familyID a character variable?

##

What are the variable names?

```{r}
names(galtondata)
```

How many observations are there?

```{r}
nrow(galtondata)
```

Are there any cases with `NA` values?

```{r}
sum(!complete.cases(galtondata))
```

# dplyr Verbs for Observ.<br>(Manipulating Rows)

## 

These functions act on the rows (observations) of a dataset, but they generally use the values of one or more variables to select or manipulate the rows.

* [`arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html)

Sort the rows (observations) according to one or more variables.

* [`count()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/count.html)

Count the number of rows (observations) that fall in categories created by one or more variables.

* [`distinct()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/distinct.html)

Subset all unique rows (observations) based on values of one or more variables / remove duplicate observations.

##

* [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html)

Subset rows (observations) to reduce the number of rows.

* [`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html)

Group rows (observations), often prior to summarizing. Does not typically reduce the size of the dataset.

* [`slice()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/slice.html)

Subset rows (observations) using their positions in the dataset. Often used with `arrange()`.

* [`summarize()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html)

Summarize rows (observations) into a smaller number of rows. Often used with `group_by()`.

## Categorical `filter()`

Reduce the dataset's rows so it only contains observations for daughters. Note the use of the logical equals `==` and category name in quotes within [`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html).

```{r}
galton_daughters <- galtondata %>% 
  filter(Child == "Daughter")
head(galton_daughters, n = 5)
```

## Quantitative `filter()`

Reduce the dataset so it contains only observations for mothers less than 5 feet tall (60 inches). Numbers do not need quotes.

```{r}
galton_shortermoms <- galtondata %>% 
  filter(Mother < 60)
head(galton_shortermoms, n = 5)
```

## Using Two Filters

Reduce the dataset so it contains only daughters with mothers less than 5 feet tall. The logical `&` (and) is implied by the comma in `filter()`. For *or* we can use a `|` between statements.

```{r}
galton_daughters_with_shorter_moms <- galtondata %>%
  filter(
    Child == "Daughter",
    Mother < 60
  )
head(galton_daughters_with_shorter_moms, n = 1)
```

## The `%in%` Operator

We can filter based on set membership using `%in%` (multiple *or*). Recall that `FamilyID` is a categorical variable in this dataset.

```{r}
families_1_2_136A <- galtondata %>% 
  filter(FamilyID %in% c("1", "2", "136A"))
head(families_1_2_136A)
```

## Variable Summaries

We use [`summarize()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) to compute different kinds of quantitative summaries of variables, such as `mean()`. The output is a smaller dataset, which can be further operated on by dplyr verbs. 

Each summary is a column in the output dataset, and there is only a single row---we have summarized *all* observations in the original dataset into one set of informative values.

```{r}
galtondata %>% 
  summarize(mean_ht = mean(Height), sd_ht = sd(Height))
```

## Grouped Variable Summaries

If we use [`group_by()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) before `summarize()`, the summaries will be calculated separately for different sub-groupings (groups of rows) in the dataset. Here we have separate summaries for the observations (rows) representing daughters versus sons. Each of the subgroups becomes a row in the output dataset.

```{r}
galtondata %>% 
  group_by(Child) %>% 
  summarize(mean_ht = mean(Height), sd_ht = sd(Height))
```
