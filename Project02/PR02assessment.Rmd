This is a free-form reflection about the process of completing and submitting Project 1. I want to see your honest self-assessment of your own performance in the context of completing the project, as well as your assessment of your partners. For example, did you: (1) do the work you committed to do in a timely manner; (2) communicate well and quickly; (3) attend class work periods and any other scheduled meetings; (4) consult as needed with your partners and/or Dr. Thomley? Refer back to your original work plan to provide context for your assessments. Tell me the good and the bad.
